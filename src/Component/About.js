                    <p className="v-pan"> A pandemic is the global outbreak of a disease.
                        COVID-19 began as an epidemic in China, before making its way around the world in a matter of months and becoming a pandemic.
                        Covid-19 pandemic affected our lives too much in both positive and negative way. It was declared on March 12, 2020 in India.
                        Due to Covid-19 virus, We all faced many problems, we lose our friends, family as well as our jobs and many more.
                        It was tough time for everyone. Our work culture, studies, way of living all gets changed.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Lockdown has drastic effects on social and economic fronts. However, this lockdown also has some positive effect on natural environment.
                        Recent data released by NASA and ESA indicates that pollution in some of the epicenters of COVID-19 such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain and USA etc. has reduced up to 30%.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Lockdown affects our college studies.
                        Schools and families had to react rapidly to a new teaching and learning platform.
                        Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students’ learning.  The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The first thought that came to our mind was whether we would ever be able to go back to school and meet our friends and teachers. Soon our doubts were laid to rest when our esteemed teachers called and explained that virtual classes will be conducted through digital platforms.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The pandemic gave many of us a taste of too much unstructured time. During the lockdown, We all have lot of time to explore ourself and lean new skills. Many of us was busy in life due to job, colleges etc, But Lockdown gives us time to connect with our parents and to care them.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The lockdown has given us the opportunity to value the quality time that we can spend with the family. We can engage ourselves in doing some interesting activities like washing the car with dad, watering the plants with grandfather, cooking delicious snacks with mom and listening to fun stories from grandmother.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Lockdown has taught us how to adapt to the challenging circumstances and learn to deal with the ordeals effectively.
